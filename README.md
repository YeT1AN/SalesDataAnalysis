## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, file handling, and data visualization. It reads sales data from text and JSON files, processes the data, performs logical calculations, and visualizes the results using PyEcharts.

## Features
- **Data Encapsulation:** Utilizes classes to encapsulate data and ensure proper separation of concerns.
- **Abstract File Reader:** Implements an abstract class with subclasses for reading different types of files (text and JSON) containing sales data.
- **Data Computation:** Computes daily sales amounts by accumulating sales for each day across different months.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Utilizes PyEcharts to create bar charts that visually represent the daily sales summaries.

## Technologies and Concepts
- **Python:** The entire project is implemented in Python.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Used to create classes that provide a structured approach for managing and processing data.
- **File Handling:** Demonstrates how to read data from both text and JSON files.
- **Abstract Classes and Subclasses:** Implements an abstract class that defines the structure for reading data and subclasses to provide specific implementations.
- **Data Encapsulation:** Uses classes and objects to encapsulate and manage data efficiently.
- **Logical Calculations:** Computes daily sales amounts by accumulating sales for each day across different months.
- **Data Visualization with PyEcharts:** Creates bar charts using PyEcharts to visualize the computed sales data.
